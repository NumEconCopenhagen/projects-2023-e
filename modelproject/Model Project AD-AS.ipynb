    "The objective of this model analysis project is to demonstrate proficiency in applying numerical model analysis methods, structuring a code project, documenting code, and presenting results in text form and figures. The project involves analyzing an economic model, solving it using optimization routines or equation solvers, simulating the model, visualizing the solution across different parameterizations, and analyzing one or more extensions of the baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we have chosen to work with the AD-AS (Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply) model, which is a fundamental model in macroeconomics. The AD-AS model provides insights into the relationship between output (real GDP) and inflation in an economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the AD-AS model, we have utilized numerical methods implemented in Python. The code is structured in a self-contained notebook (.ipynb) format, accompanied by fully documented Python files (.py). \n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps of the analysis are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm Description: We describe the algorithm used to solve the economic model, explaining the equations and relationships involved.\n",
    "Solving the Model: We employ numerical optimization and equation solving techniques to find the equilibrium solutions of the AD-AS model. This involves determining the steady-state equation, converting it into a function, and solving for the equilibrium output level.\n",
    "Visualization of Solutions: We plot the AD and AS curves, showcasing the relationship between output and inflation. The interactive plot allows us to adjust the shocks and observe the impact on the model.\n",
    "Extension of the Baseline Model: To further explore the model, we introduce an extension by incorporating a monetary policy rule known as the Taylor Rule. This allows us to analyze the effects of different monetary policy settings on equilibrium output and inflation.\n",
    "The limitations of the project include the minimal use of sympy, as the focus is primarily on numerical solutions. The emphasis is on quality rather than quantity, ensuring a well-tested model with effective visualization and simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of numerical model analysis methods to the AD-AS model, showcasing the impact of different parameterizations and monetary policy settings on equilibrium output and inflation. Through proper code structuring, documentation, and visualization, the project presents a comprehensive analysis of the model, fulfilling the objectives outlined in the assignment description."
