This portfolio combines three separate analysis projects, each focusing on a different economic model.

Inaugural Project:
The "Economic Growth Analysis" project explores the relationship between economic growth and various factors, such as investment, population growth, and technological progress. The project utilizes data analysis techniques, including regression analysis and visualizations, to examine these relationships and draw insights.

Data Project:
The "Phillips Curve Analysis" project investigates the Phillips Curve, which represents the trade-off between inflation and unemployment rates. The project utilizes data from various sources and employs statistical methods, such as linear regression and correlation analysis, to analyze the relationship between inflation, unemployment, and other relevant variables.

Model Project:
The "AD-AS Model Analysis with Monetary Policy Rule" project focuses on the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply (AD-AS) model and extends it with a monetary policy rule known as the Taylor Rule. The project incorporates numerical optimization and equation solving techniques to explore the dynamics of output and inflation within the model.

Each project follows a structured approach, including data collection, cleaning, and analysis. Visualizations are used to present the results effectively. The projects also emphasize proper code structuring, documentation, and the use of relevant economic concepts.
